            <p>Please send me an email to <a href="mailto:peter@petervdam.nl">peter@petervdam.nl</a> with comments, suggestions, bug reports or anything you would like to say about FeedNews. When possible, your request will be my top priority.</p>

            <p>If you are a programmer yourself, feel free to contribute by adding new stuff or fixing broken stuff through <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/webstylecenter/Homepage/">Github</a>. If you send me a pull request, and it's a nice addition, I will make it available to anyone. Together we can make FeedNews the best tool out there.</p>

            <p>If you don't want to send a mail, but still leave feedback. A feedback form will be available soon. So please check back!</p>
